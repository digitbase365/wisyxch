          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
          <p>
            We maintain appropriate technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to provide reasonable protection for your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. The security measures include firewalls, data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. While we are dedicated to securing our systems and the Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your password(s) and Account registration information, for example, to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity and not reveal account credentials to any third-parties, and verifying that the Personal Information we maintain about you is accurate and current.  We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us.
          </p>
          <h3>Third-Party Websites and Social Media Platforms </h3>
          <p>
            The Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third-parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information, we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Services may include access to publicly accessible blogs, forums, or social media platforms. Personal information you voluntarily transmit or publish online in a publicly accessible blog, forum, or social media platform may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. By using such services, you assume the risk that your personal information may be viewed and used by third-parties for any number of purposes.

        <h2>GDPR: Data Protection Compliance</h2>
        <p>
        On May 25, 2018, a new comprehensive European Union (“EU”) privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect. The GDPR imposes new rules on companies, government agencies, non-profits, and other organizations (collectively “organizations”) that processes and/or hold Personal Data of data subjects that are citizens of or are residing in the EU. The GDPR applies to organizations established in the EU, as well as organizations based outside of the EU that offer goods or services to, or that monitor behavior of EU data subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Personal Data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (referred to as a “data subject”). Personal Data can identify the individual directly or indirectly (e.g. in combination with other information), so could include name, identification number, online identifier, location data, or other factors specific to the physical, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the person.
